            <h2>GAMEPLAY</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Playing PUBG is a rather simple gaming mechanic. In order to survive a constantly shrinking circle, 100 players jump out of the plane and are free to explore the map in pursuit of treasure. Because of this, players will unavoidably run into one another and engage in decisive close-quarters fighting. Dinner will be chicken for the winner. Eat dinner and win, or perish trying.</li>
                <li>Since every game in PUBG has a different storyline, the replay value seems to be endless. With eight different maps and randomly placed circles, players will always encounter new battle scenarios. Players have to make quick tactical decisions as the circle keeps closing, which may be a major contributing factor to the game's long-term attraction. "Which side of the circle should we choose?" and "What's the optimal position?" are examples of questions that pique curiosity and appeal to people who enjoy challenges and exhilarating experiences.</li>
                <li>But occasionally, the too big map size can be a pain. After twenty minutes of looting and fighting, you quickly return to the lobby. This is a frequent problem for numerous players. Because of this, the official 2023 roadmap calls for accelerating circle closures at the start of the game, which expedites the entire procedure. Additionally, there will be more car spawns and overall greater rewards on all maps. Eventually, this should result in a far more action-packed game experience. </li>
                <li>At the end of the day, PUBG is harsh. If you make a mistake, the quickest route back to the lobby is taken. Because of this, there is constant discussion about making the gameplay easier by adding features that allow you to revive fallen team members, like in Call of Duty and Fortnite. However, this begs the question, "Will PUBG be the same?" The more you struggle for a chicken meal, the more satisfying it will be when you finally get your hands on one. It has never been an easy ride. A difficult decision.</li>
                <li>However, its simplistic fighting system is primarily to blame for the gameplay's raw and unvarnished feel. </li>
