            <h2>POSITIVE Impact of Game</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Improved fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination can be achieved by playing video games, which often require players to control on-screen characters and objects with a mix of hand and eye actions.</li>
                <li>Improved solving issues and strategic thinking: To succeed in many video games, like PUBG Mobile, players must act quickly and wisely. Decision-making and problem-solving skills can both be improved by this.</li>
                <li>Greater teamwork and socialization: Multiplayer games, such as PUBG Mobile, can give users a place to communicate and connect with one another, which is particularly advantageous for shy or introverted people. Additionally, collaborating to accomplish shared objectives helps enhance communication and cooperation abilities.</li>
                <li>Reduce stress and relaxation: After a hard day, playing video games can be a fun and relaxing way for many people to relax. A lot of games have an immersive quality that allows users to forget about their everyday worries and enter a virtual world.</li>

             <h2>NEGATIVE Impact of Game</h2>
             <ul>
                <li>It is important for users to use PUBG Mobile wisely and carefully, just like they do with any other kind of entertainment. Any video game player who plays for a long period of time runs the risk of developing health problems like eyestrain, carpal tunnel syndrome, and back pain. To prevent these difficulties, players should take breaks and maintain proper physical hygiene. Players should also keep an eye on how much time they spend on PUBG Mobile and balance it with other things like working out, hanging out with friends and family, and getting proper sleep.</li>
                <li>When playing PUBG Mobile, gamers should also be aware of the language and in-game content they face. The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) has given the game a T (Teen) rating, meaning that players 13 years of age and older are the target audience. However, parents and guardians have the final say on if their children should play the game. In-game harassment and bullying are another possibility that players should be aware of. Players should also report any behavior that bothers them to the game's developers.</li>
