            <h2>PUBG Developer</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Apparently, Brendan Greene—who goes by the online nickname PlayerUnknown—is credited with creating the battle royale game. After he started working on the ARMA 2 DayZ: Battle Royale mod in 2013, his concept became even more intricate. He was once employed as a consultant for the creation of the battle royale game H1Z1: King of the Kill by Daybreak Game Company, then known as Sony Online Entertainment.</li>
                <li>But soon after it was out, Chang-han Kim contacted Greene to work on PUBG. He was able to make his goal come true by working with Kim. That was the course of events.</li>
                <li>PUBG used to be really glitchy in the beginning. The number of technical problems was excessive and their resolution was slow. It was really annoying that the game crashed all the time, especially in the later stages. Basically, when you were playing the game, it happened at least once every day. After your game crashed while you were operating a vehicle, you managed to get back in, but by then, your squad members had reported that you were drowning in the sea. Notably, not a lot of players were turned off by it. </li>
                <li>Now that the game is stable, crashes are quite infrequent. Sadly, the overall performance of the game was never able to live up to its full potential.</li>
                <li>The numerous game sections, upgrades, and roadmaps over the years have demonstrated that developers do, in fact, consider the community when making administrative decisions. The game is regularly updated, and a comprehensive patch report and 2023 roadmap are included with every release. That gives players a longer-term incentive to continue playing the game. But the true soul of PUBG lies in its gameplay.</li>
