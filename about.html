            <h2>About PUBG</h2>
                    <P>Players participate in a furious last-man-standing battle in the competitive PVP survival shooter, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. When it was released back in March 2017, it became the first of its type and the inspiration behind the battle royale genre, starting a gaming revolution. PUBG became the fastest Early Access game to exceed one million copies sold in less than a month with over a million copies sold in its first month of release. It quickly ascended the charts and set multiple Guinness World Records in the process.</P>
                    <P>Bluehole Ginno Games, a South Korean studio that later changed its name to PUBG Studios in response to the game's enormous financial success in 2017, was the original developer of the game. The studio progressed to a holding company called Krafton in 2018, one year later, and as a result, it was published under this name.</P>
                    <P>Chang-han Kim and Brendan Greene were the brains behind that innovative gaming experience. Executive producer Kim approached Greene with the notion of creating a battle royale survival shooter. Eventually, he was promoted to creative director, a role he held until March 2019, when he departed the firm to begin work on an open-world sandbox project in Amsterdam.</P>
                    <P>Following the release of PUBG, the community gave a great response. It was commended for being innovative and providing a novel gaming experience. PUBG's rise was also greatly aided by well-known Twitch streamers and other content producers. For 3.2 million peak players in a single day in January 2018, it continues to claim the Steam Top Record. Nevertheless, to put things in perspective, this represents approximately the daily total of Fortnite players in 2023.</P>
                    <P>Even so, PUBG manages to maintain its position among the industry's titans, like Apex Legends, Dota 2, and Counter-Strike. </P>
